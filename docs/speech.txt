Last Saturday, my friends and I went to the zoo. We were very excited because it was our first time visiting. The weather was sunny, and the animals were very active. We saw many different kinds of animals such as lions, tigers, monkeys, and elephants.

The lions were lying in the sun, looking very relaxed. The monkeys were jumping from tree to tree, making funny noises. The elephants were walking slowly, and we could hear their heavy footsteps. We also visited the bird house and saw many beautiful birds, such as parrots and peacocks. It was amazing to see so many different animals in one place.

We spent the whole afternoon at the zoo and had a great time. It was a wonderful experience, and I hope to visit the zoo again soon.
